## Instructions

When you click on a challenge, you are greeted with:

- an RPC endpoint
- a faucet link
- a netcat `nc` command

You can see further instruction when you enter the netcat command.

> [!NOTE]
>
> When you get the deployer address, you can fund that address at the faucet.

You will also need a solver account (preferably a throw-away) and you can fund that at the faucet as well.
